I remember, back in 2002, we moved from our village (Khararia, Narail, Khulna) to Dhaka (capital of **Bangladesh**, housing the best educational institutions in my country) to pursue a better education. At that time, my elementary level art teacher **Robin Mandal** sir told me to do something for my village and our country. Although, I was too young to understand his words. Now, it's definitely one of the driving forces for me.

My interest in tech started to grow while I was at High School, which along with other factors was a boost to choose Computer Science as my field of studies. 
> Definitely one of the best decisions of my life.

I have always found it fascinating to play with **data** and playing with patterns. It always amazes me, and I find it pleasing to find insights from data. These are the reasons I find *Deep Learning* tasks the most interesting. 

I was first introduced to Machine Learning during my Artificial Intelligence course at **East West University**. Which was the initial boost for me to choose a research-oriented career path.  My research interests are in **NLP**, **Computer Vision**, and all-in-all **Deep Learning**.

Moreover, I love to learn new things. I believe -

During my leisure time, I find it relaxing scraping "websites" and generating data/ideas for deep learning projects. You can consider it as my hobby. Moreover, I love playing competitive BR/FPS games.

Although, 2020 was a hard year for everyone, I wishing everyone the best for the upcoming years.
