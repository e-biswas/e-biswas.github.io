  * **Symptom-Based Disease Detection System In Bengali Using Convolution Neural Network**
    
    Natural language processing (NLP) and automatic detection of the disease have become popular in the recent era. Several research work show disease detection system in several languages. We present a disease detection system from the clinical text which is in Bengali language consisting of a numerous set of diacritic character, at a sentence-level classification. The clinical dataset consisting of Bengali text which is generally user interpreted symptom for the most common disease. Also, our approach represents the NLP methodology for Bengali language processing and classification of disease using several types of neural networks with hyperparameter tuning and word vectorization. The aim of the research is the initial detection of disease from the user's voice to text data, in our case Bengali. So, a speech recognition system developed in the Bengali language is used to feed the disease detection model and finalizing the output with the model-detected disease.

  * **Privacy & Security Perspective on Social Media, Case - Facebook**
  
  Privacy and security have become one of the main key concerns con-sidering the rapid growth of technology. The main intension of our study is to understand the security and privacy related information among the young gener-ation of Bangladeshi people, mostly students. As it is very necessary for us to understand if they are well aware of their privacy over social media, which now a days has become a trend rather than using them as a communication media, we have conducted a survey among university students (635 response) to explore their opinion on the issue. So far, we have found that most of the students are having a lack of knowledge that they are losing their privacy and security online without being aware of the information they are sharing with others. In addition, the study represents relation behind losing privacy over social media considering various factors. The main intention of our study is to explore userâ€™s knowledge on privacy policy, data policy as well as some real-time data collection of Face-book and how they react when they get to know about the technical scenario. Moreover, our objective was to create awareness regarding the topic and which was successfully obtained throughout the survey. The research exemplifies the output of survey response and the outcome can be useful for making user friendly data policies along with along with raising awareness.
